# FFTA - Fastest(?) Fourier Transform for Arduino

# Introduction
This project is about a fast C implementation of the Discrete Fourier Transform[1], [2] for the Arduino. FFTA computes the DFT from *real* input data, for example data coming from the (10-bit) ADC.

On the 8-points data set example: x=[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], the MATLAB function fft(x) returns:

*1.0000+0.0000i   0.7071-0.7071i   0.0000-1.0000i  -0.7071-0.7071i  -1.0000+0.0000i  -0.7071+0.7071i   0.0000+1.0000i   0.7071+0.7071i*

the *dft4* sketch for example returns:

*1.00,	0.00*
*0.71,	-0.71*
*0.00,	-1.00*
*-0.71,	-0.71*
*-1.00,	0.00*
*-0.71,	0.71*
*0.00,	1.00*
*0.71,	0.71*

Basically, the DFT formula is nothing more than two wave generators stepping in frequency and calculating the 'power' in each frequency bin from the frequency spectrum.

The DFT-core implemented in the C-language looks like:

In FFTA the trigonometric functions and the angle stepping are replaced by Direct Digital Synthesis wave generators using a look-up table[4], which is pretty fast on an 8-bit micro-controller.
Sketch *dft2* with the 32-bit phase accumulator has a very high frequency resolution and might be more accurate when transforming large input vectors (to be investigated).

There is no internal overflow check on numbers. The 10-bit range from the ADC is safe to use for input.

# Sketches
Sketch | purpose
------ | -------
dft1.ino | DFT - floating point implementation using sin() and cos() functions
dft2.ino | DFT with 32bit DDS, 10bit Look-up table (LUT)
dft3.ino | DFT with 16bit DDS, 10bit LUT
dft4.ino | DFT with 16bit DDS, 8bit LUT

# Benchmarks
Shown in the table below are the measured execution times in Î¼s of the different FFTA variants on the Arduino UNO for the full spectrum calculation (positive and negative frequencies).
The data set that was used for bench-marking is: x = 0, 1, 0, 0, ...  [3].

N-points: / Implementation: | dft1 | dft2 | dft3 | dft4 | remark
-------------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ------
8 | 16436 | 1996 | 968 | 720 | input data type: int or double
16 | 66040 | 7552 | 3500 | 2568 | input data type: int
32 | 265880 | 29636 | 13548 | 9812 | input data type: int
64 | 1073796 | 117644 | 53540 | 38600 | input data type: int

### Conclusion
The computing time of *dft1 - dft4* scales with N^2 as expected. The speed ratio of dft1:dft2:dft3:dft4 is about: 26:3:1.5:1.
The FFT algorithm scales with N*log(N) [1]. An integer math implementation of the FFT on the Arduino might be faster than the method proposed here, but this needs to be confirmed.

# Library
